## About CIRCUS

The Collegiate Incident Response Competition for Undergraduate Students (CIRCUS) is WCCOMPS's digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) competition. Unlike CCDC which focuses on defense, CIRCUS challenges students to investigate security incidents after they occur, analyzing artifacts and piecing together what happened.

## Competition Focus

CIRCUS emphasizes:
- **Digital Forensics** - Analyzing disk images, memory dumps, and file systems
- **Incident Response** - Determining attack vectors and timelines
- **Log Analysis** - Finding evidence in system and application logs
- **Malware Analysis** - Understanding attacker tools and techniques
- **Report Writing** - Documenting findings professionally
- **Tool Proficiency** - Using industry-standard DFIR tools

## Format

### Pre-Competition

Teams receive:
- Scenario background and context
- Initial incident notification
- Available evidence sources
- Investigation questions and objectives
- Reporting requirements

### Competition Day

**Investigation Phase (4-6 hours)**
- Analyze provided forensic images
- Examine log files and artifacts
- Reconstruct attack timeline
- Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Document chain of custody
- Answer specific investigation questions

**Reporting Phase (2-3 hours)**
- Write comprehensive incident report
- Present findings and recommendations
- Answer questions from judges
- Defend conclusions and methodology

### Scoring Criteria

Teams are evaluated on:
- **Accuracy** - Correctness of findings (40%)
- **Completeness** - Thoroughness of investigation (25%)
- **Methodology** - Proper forensic procedures (15%)
- **Documentation** - Quality of reports (15%)
- **Presentation** - Communication of findings (5%)

## Skills Developed

Participants gain experience in:
- Forensic tool usage (FTK, Autopsy, Volatility, etc.)
- Timeline analysis and reconstruction
- Network traffic analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)
- Windows and Linux forensics
- Memory forensics
- Mobile device forensics
- Cloud and container forensics
- Threat intelligence application

## Competition Scenarios

Past CIRCUS competitions have featured:
- Insider threat investigations
- Ransomware incident response
- APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) analysis
- Data breach investigations
- Compromised web server forensics
- Business email compromise cases

Each scenario is based on real-world incidents adapted for educational purposes.

## Eligibility

CIRCUS is open to:
- Undergraduate students at accredited institutions
- Teams of 3-5 students
- Schools in the Western region and beyond
- Students at all skill levels (beginner-friendly)
