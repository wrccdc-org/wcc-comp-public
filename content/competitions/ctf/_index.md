## What is CTF?

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity challenges where participants solve security-related puzzles to find hidden "flags" - strings of text that prove successful completion of a challenge. CTFs are excellent for developing specific technical skills in a fun, competitive environment.

## Types of CTF

### Jeopardy-Style CTF

**Format:**
- Categories of challenges (Web, Crypto, Forensics, etc.)
- Each challenge worth points based on difficulty
- Solve challenges in any order
- Individual or team participation
- Time-limited event (usually 24-48 hours)

**Challenge Categories:**
- **Web Exploitation** - Finding vulnerabilities in web applications
- **Cryptography** - Breaking codes and encryption
- **Forensics** - Analyzing files and data
- **Reverse Engineering** - Understanding compiled code
- **Binary Exploitation** - Exploiting program vulnerabilities
- **OSINT** - Open source intelligence gathering
- **Miscellaneous** - Various security concepts

### Attack-Defense CTF

**Format:**
- Teams have identical vulnerable servers
- Defend your services while attacking opponents
- Points for service uptime and successful attacks
- Continuous, real-time competition
- More complex than Jeopardy-style

### King of the Hill

**Format:**
- Single vulnerable machine or network
- Teams compete to gain and maintain control
- Points awarded for time controlling the target
- Defensive and offensive skills required
- Fast-paced and chaotic
