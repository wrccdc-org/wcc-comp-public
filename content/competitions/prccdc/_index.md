## About PRCCDC

The Pacific Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (PRCCDC) serves schools in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and other Pacific territories. As part of the National CCDC program, PRCCDC provides students in these unique regions with the same world-class cyber defense competition experience as other CCDC regions.

## Why PRCCDC?

### Addressing Unique Challenges

Pacific Rim schools face distinct challenges:
- Geographic isolation from other competition regions
- Limited local cybersecurity industry presence
- Higher travel costs to mainland competitions
- Unique infrastructure and connectivity considerations

PRCCDC was created to ensure students in these regions have equal access to premier cybersecurity competition opportunities.

### Regional Pride

PRCCDC celebrates the unique characteristics of Pacific Rim schools and their contributions to cybersecurity education. The competition scenarios often incorporate challenges relevant to island and remote network security.

## Competition Format

PRCCDC follows the standard CCDC format:
- Teams defend corporate networks against red team attacks
- Maintain critical business services
- Handle realistic business injects
- Work under time pressure and stress
- Demonstrate technical and teamwork skills

See our [WRCCDC page](/competitions/wrccdc/) for detailed format information, as PRCCDC uses the same general structure.
