## Resources

WCCOMPS believes in giving back to the community through open-source projects, archived competition materials, and educational resources. Everything here is free to use and contribute to.

## Open Source Projects

We maintain several open-source projects on GitHub that support competition operations and cybersecurity education. Visit our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/wrccdc-org) to explore all projects.

### Competitor Container
A containerized environment allowing teams to request tools and resources for their optional "jump box" access during competitions. Provides isolated, controlled access to security tools.

**Technology:** Docker  
**Repository:** [github.com/wrccdc-org/competitor-container](https://github.com/wrccdc-org/competitor-container)

### Aweful DNS
A DNS proxy specifically designed for WRCCDC competitions. Handles complex DNS requirements for competition infrastructure while maintaining realistic constraints.

**Technology:** Go  
**Repository:** [github.com/wrccdc-org/aweful-dns](https://github.com/wrccdc-org/aweful-dns)

### Container Images
Shared repository for container images built for WRCCDC. Includes various service containers, scoring engines, and infrastructure components used in our competitions.

**Technology:** Python, Docker  
**Repository:** [github.com/wrccdc-org/container-images](https://github.com/wrccdc-org/container-images)

### Arena Website
The WRCCDC Arena website provides a simple but useful page with links for students during competitions. Includes quick access to documentation, scoring, and support.

**Technology:** HTML/CSS  
**Repository:** [github.com/wrccdc-org/arena.wrccdc.org](https://github.com/wrccdc-org/arena.wrccdc.org)

### Website Source
The source code for the WRCCDC website built with Hugo. A great reference for other competitions looking to build similar sites.

**Technology:** Hugo  
**Repository:** [github.com/wrccdc-org/Website-Hugo-Source-Code](https://github.com/wrccdc-org/Website-Hugo-Source-Code)
